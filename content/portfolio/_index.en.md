<h3> Modular headphones (2022) </h3> 

My approach to sustainability involves making products more durable through foresight during development. <br><br>
Using the headset as an example, I focused on measures that make the product itself more robust and accessible for repairs and upgrades.
The aesthetic design should consistently reflect authenticity, honesty, and functionality to avoid the constant changes in fashion.

<h3> LED-Matrix Digital Mockup (2023) </h3> 

In order to illustrate the concept of an animatable matrix LED rear light, a DMU was created using a game engine.<br><br>

This allows real-time presentation of different configurations of the LED matrix, which can be freely combined via a user interface.

<h3> Bluetooth Speaker / Corporate Design </h3>

The task was to place a selected electrical appliance in a new enclosure with a completely new and rather inappropriate brand context.<br><br>
I opted for a bluetooth box with the brand design of NVIDIA, which was (at the time) primarily known as a graphics card manufacturer. Inspired by the company's innovative strength, I also gave the Bluetooth box a USP: The speaker can be folded up to protect the interface and save space, while in the unfolded state it allows a larger sound volume and thus greater music enjoyment.
