> ##### **Liability for content** 

All content on my website has been created with the utmost care and to the best of my knowledge. However, I cannot assume any liability for the correctness, completeness and topicality of the contents. As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 para.1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) and general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, I am not obliged as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general legislation remain unaffected by this.

However, liability in this respect is only possible from the time at which we become aware of a specific infringement. If I become aware of the above-mentioned infringements, I will remove this content immediately.

> ##### **Limitation of liability for external links**

My website contains links to external websites of third parties. I have no influence on the content of these directly or indirectly linked websites. Therefore, I cannot accept any liability for the accuracy of the content of the "external links". The respective providers or operators (authors) of the sites are responsible for the content of the external links.

The external links were checked for possible legal violations at the time the links were created and were free of illegal content at the time the links were created. It is not possible to constantly check the content of external links without concrete evidence of an infringement. In the case of direct or indirect links to third-party websites that lie outside my area of responsibility, a liability obligation would only exist if I were aware of the content and it would be technically possible and reasonable for me to prevent use in the event of illegal content.

This disclaimer also applies to links and references set within the own website "heider.design" by questioners, bloggers and guests of the discussion forum. For illegal, incorrect or incomplete contents and in particular for damages resulting from the use or non-use of such information, only the service provider of the page to which reference is made is liable, not the person who has linked to the respective page.
